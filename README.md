# Autopilot implementation with estimator API and low level graph API

This repo contains the implementation of autopilot described in this paper [End to end deep learning for self driving cars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) with some modifications. The model is defined in the file model and then a graph is created to run during training and inference sessions which predict the 1/r value given a training set or a particular image stream. The current implementation is based on the autopilot implementation of David Cardozo (more information [here](https://github.com/Davidnet/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3))
